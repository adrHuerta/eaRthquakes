Mastering Software Development in R Capstone

## Description

The overall goal of the capstone project is to integrate the skills which I have developed over the courses in the Specialization and to build a software package that can be used to work with the NOAA Significant Earthquakes dataset.

## NOAA Significant Earthquakes

The [Significant Earthquake Database](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1) contains information on destructive earthquakes from 2150 B.C. to the present that meet at least one of the following criteria: Moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), 10 or more deaths, Magnitude 7.5 or greater, Modified Mercalli Intensity X or greater, or the earthquake generated a tsunami.
